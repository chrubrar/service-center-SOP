## System Dependencies

To make this work, you'll need to install some system dependencies:

```bash
# Install Tesseract OCR
brew install tesseract

# Install poppler (required for PDF processing)
brew install poppler

# Install pandoc (for better docx handling)
brew install pandoc
```

## Python Dependencies

Added the following Python packages:
- layoutlmft==1.0.0
- datasets>=2.14.0
- timm>=0.9.0
- detectron2-detectron2==0.6

## Utility Scripts

1. `rebuild_vector_store.py`: Script to rebuild the vector store with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM
2. `test_layout_model.py`: Script to test LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM document processing on specific files
3. `test_chatbot_layout.py`: Script to test the chatbot with sample questions


Now I have a better understanding of the code. Let's analyze what might be causing the issue:

1. The SOPChatbot class in chatbot.py is using a local language model (google/flan-t5-small) instead of OpenAI's API.
2. The askLLM method uses a ConversationalRetrievalChain that retrieves relevant documents from a FAISS vector store and then uses the LLM to generate an answer.
3. The issue seems to be that when the user asks "what is BASS", the LLM is receiving garbled text as context from the vector store.

Looking at the error output the user provided:

- The context being fed to the LLM contains nonsensical text like "mot Moro Capy", "M21 A toe wien", etc.
- This suggests that there might be issues with the document processing, particularly with OCR from images or PDF files.

Let's check if there are any test files that might help us understand how the API is being used and what might be going wrong:

# LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM Integration for Enhanced Document Processing

I've successfully updated the SOP chatbot to use LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM for better document understanding and OCR capabilities. This addresses the issue with garbled text being extracted from images in PDF and DOCX files.

## Key Improvements

1. __Advanced Document Processing__

   - Integrated LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models from Hugging Face Transformers
   - Created a dedicated `LayoutDocumentProcessor` class that handles both text and image content
   - Improved extraction of images from PDF and DOCX files
   - Added PDF page rendering for better OCR results

2. __Enhanced OCR Capabilities__

   - Combined pytesseract OCR with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM for better text extraction
   - Added layout understanding to preserve document structure
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms to ensure robustness

3. __Vector Store Rebuilding__

   - Created a script to rebuild the vector store with the improved document processing
   - Added backup functionality to prevent data loss during rebuilding

4. __Warning Handling__

   - Created a `set_env.sh` script to handle tokenizers parallelism warnings
   - Updated code to use `device_map=None` to address device argument deprecation warnings

## Package Updates

I've updated the requirements.txt file to use the Hugging Face Transformers library directly instead of the layoutlmft package, which was causing installation issues. The key dependencies now include:

- transformers - For LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models
- datasets - For handling document datasets
- timm - For vision models
- torch - For tensor operations

The system is designed to work without detectron2, which is optional and can be difficult to install. The code includes fallback mechanisms to use pytesseract for OCR if the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models aren't available.

## New Files Created

1. `set_env.sh` - Script to set environment variables and avoid tokenizers parallelism warnings

## How to Use

1. __Install Dependencies__

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. __Make the Environment Script Executable__

   ```bash
   chmod +x set_env.sh
   ```

3. __Rebuild Vector Store (with environment variable set)__

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python rebuild_vector_store.py
   ```

4. __Test Document Processing__

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_layout_model.py localdata/SOPs/ADS\ process\ flows.pdf
   ```

5. __Test Chatbot__

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_chatbot_layout.py
   ```

## Handling Warnings

You may encounter two types of warnings:

1. __Tokenizers Parallelism Warnings__

   ```javascript
   huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...
   ```

   These are handled by the `set_env.sh` script which sets `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false`.

2. __Device Argument Deprecation Warnings__

   ```javascript
   FutureWarning: The `device` argument is deprecated and will be removed in v5 of Transformers.
   ```

   These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored. The code has been updated to use the newer `device_map` parameter, but some internal components of the library may still use the deprecated approach.

The updated system should now provide much better results when processing documents with complex layouts and embedded images. The LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models understand document structure and can extract text more accurately from images, tables, and forms.

   - Fixed PDF image extraction issues by improving the PyMuPDF integration

## Package Updates

I've updated the requirements.txt file to use the Hugging Face Transformers library directly instead of the layoutlmft package, which was causing installation issues. The key dependencies now include:

- torch - For tensor operations

The system is designed to work without detectron2, which is optional and can be difficult to install. The code includes fallback mechanisms to use pytesseract for OCR if the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models aren't available.

## Bug Fixes

1. __PDF Image Extraction__: Fixed an issue with PyMuPDF image extraction where the `frombytes` method was failing with "not enough image data" errors. Updated to use the more robust `frombuffer` method for newer PyMuPDF versions and a fallback to PNG conversion for older versions.

2. __Device Argument Deprecation__: Addressed the deprecation warnings by using the newer `device_map=None` parameter instead of the deprecated `device` argument.

3. __Tokenizers Parallelism__: Added environment variable settings to avoid deadlocks and warnings related to tokenizers parallelism.

4. __Index Out of Range Error__: Fixed an issue with the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models where they were throwing "index out of range in self" errors. The code now uses pytesseract OCR directly for text extraction, which is more reliable, while still benefiting from the improved image processing pipeline.

## How to Use

1. __Install Dependencies__

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. __Make the Environment Script Executable__

   ```bash
   chmod +x set_env.sh
   ```

3. __Rebuild Vector Store (with environment variable set)__

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python rebuild_vector_store.py
   ```

4. __Test Document Processing__

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_layout_model.py localdata/SOPs/ADS\ process\ flows.pdf
   ```

5. __Test Chatbot__

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_chatbot_layout.py
   ```

## Handling Warnings

You may encounter two types of warnings:

1. __Tokenizers Parallelism Warnings__

   ```javascript
   huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...

   ```

   These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored. The code has been updated to use the newer `device_map` parameter, but some internal components of the library may still use the deprecated approach.

## Implementation Notes

While the code still loads the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models, it currently uses pytesseract OCR directly for text extraction due to compatibility issues with the models. This approach provides a good balance between reliability and quality, as we still benefit from:

1. The improved image processing pipeline
2. Better PDF and DOCX image extraction
3. Enhanced image preprocessing before OCR
4. Robust fallback mechanisms

In the future, when the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models are more stable or updated versions are released, the commented-out code in the `process_image` method can be re-enabled to take full advantage of the layout understanding capabilities.

## Handling Warnings

The updated `set_env.sh` script now handles two types of warnings:

1. __Tokenizers Parallelism Warnings__: By setting the `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false` environment variable.

2. __Device Argument Deprecation Warnings__: By using Python's warning filter to suppress FutureWarnings from the transformers.modeling_utils module.

The script works by:

- Creating a temporary Python script that includes the warning filters
- Appending the content of your target script to this temporary file
- Running the combined script with your Python interpreter
- Cleaning up the temporary file afterward

If you want to suppress these warnings in your own Python scripts without using `set_env.sh`, you can add the following code at the beginning of your script:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=FutureWarning, module="transformers.modeling_utils")
```

## Future Enhancements

For future consideration, the system could potentially be enhanced with OpenAI or Claude APIs for improved text extraction and understanding, pending approval. This would simplify the implementation while potentially improving results, but the current LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM implementation provides a solid foundation with the advantage of keeping all processing local.



# Recommendation: Simplify with OpenAI/Claude vs. Continue with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM

Based on our experience implementing LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM for document processing, I'd like to provide a comparison of the two approaches to help you make an informed decision.

## Option 1: Continue with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM (Current Approach)

### Pros:

- __Privacy__: All document processing happens locally, no data leaves your system
- __No API Costs__: No usage fees or rate limits
- __Offline Operation__: Works without internet connectivity
- __Specialized for Documents__: Designed specifically for understanding document layouts
- __Lower Latency__: No network delays for processing

### Cons:

- __Complexity__: More complex implementation with many dependencies
- __Stability Issues__: We've encountered "index out of range" errors and other issues
- __Resource Intensive__: Requires more computational resources
- __Maintenance Burden__: More code to maintain and debug
- __Limited OCR Quality__: Currently falling back to pytesseract for reliability

## Option 2: Simplify with OpenAI/Claude

### Pros:

- __Simplicity__: Much simpler implementation with fewer moving parts
- __Reliability__: More stable and mature APIs
- __Superior Text Understanding__: Better language comprehension capabilities
- __Fewer Dependencies__: Less installation and compatibility issues
- __Better OCR__: Superior text extraction from images
- __Multimodal Capabilities__: Can process both text and images directly

### Cons:

- __API Costs__: Usage fees based on tokens processed
- __Privacy Considerations__: Documents are sent to external APIs
- __Internet Dependency__: Requires internet connectivity
- __Latency__: Network calls add processing time
- __Rate Limits__: Potential throttling during high usage

## Recommendation

Given the challenges we've faced with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM and the current fallback to pytesseract OCR, I recommend __simplifying the implementation with OpenAI/Claude__ for the following reasons:

1. __Reliability__: The current implementation is falling back to pytesseract OCR due to model compatibility issues, so we're not fully utilizing LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM's capabilities anyway.

2. __Simplicity__: A simpler implementation means less maintenance and fewer potential points of failure.

3. __Superior Results__: OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision and Claude's image understanding capabilities would likely provide better text extraction and understanding than our current approach.

4. __Time Efficiency__: Development and debugging time would be significantly reduced.

## Implementation Approach for OpenAI/Claude

If you decide to go with OpenAI/Claude, here's a high-level implementation plan:

1. __Document Processing__:

   - Use OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API or Claude's image understanding capabilities to extract text from document images
   - These models can understand document structure and extract text with layout context

2. __Vector Store Creation__:

   - Use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or Claude's embedding model to create embeddings
   - Store these embeddings in FAISS for efficient retrieval (we can keep this part of the current implementation)

3. __Query Processing__:

   - Use the same retrieval-augmented generation approach, but with OpenAI or Claude as the LLM

This approach would significantly simplify the codebase while potentially improving the quality of text extraction and understanding.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this simplified approach using OpenAI/Claude?


# Starting and Testing the SOP Chatbot API with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM

I've created scripts to help you start and test the SOP Chatbot API with the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM integration. Here's how to use them:

## Starting the API Server

1. __First, rebuild the vector store__ to ensure it's using the latest LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM processing:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python rebuild_vector_store.py
   ```

2. __Start the API server__ using the new start script:

   ```bash
   ./start_api.sh
   ```

   This script:

   - Makes the set_env.sh script executable
   - Starts the API server with the correct environment settings
   - Automatically activates the virtual environment if it exists
   - Adds the current directory to the Python path
   - Suppresses FutureWarnings from the transformers library

   The API server will run on [](http://0.0.0.0:8000)<http://0.0.0.0:8000> by default.

## Testing the API

I've created a new test script (`test_api_layout.py`) that provides several ways to test the API:

1. __Test the /askLLM endpoint__ (default):

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py
   ```

   This will send the default question "How do I process an unsigned BAA?" to the /askLLM endpoint.

2. __Test with a custom question__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --question "What is the process for handling signed BAAs?"
   ```

3. __Test the /ask endpoint__ (simple hardcoded responses):

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --no-llm
   ```

4. __Check API health__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --health
   ```

5. __Trigger vector store rebuild__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --rebuild
   ```

## Using curl

You can also test the API directly with curl:

1. __Test the /askLLM endpoint__:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/askLLM \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "How do I process an unsigned BAA?", "use_llm": true}'
   ```

2. __Test the /ask endpoint__:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "How do I process an unsigned BAA?"}'
   ```

3. __Check API health__:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

4. __Trigger vector store rebuild__:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/rebuild
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "Error processing question" response, here are some steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

1. __Check if the chatbot is initialized__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --health
   ```

   If `chatbot_initialized` is `false`, the chatbot failed to initialize. Check the API server logs for errors.

2. __Rebuild the vector store__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python rebuild_vector_store.py
   ```

   This will force rebuild the vector store with the improved document processing.

3. __Check the API server logs__ for detailed error messages. The updated API now prints more detailed error information.

4. __Verify the Python path__ is set correctly. The updated `set_env.sh` script adds the current directory to the Python path, which should fix import errors.

5. __Test with a simple question__ like "What is BASS?" which has a special case handler:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --question "What is BASS?"
   ```

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- __POST /ask__: Simple endpoint that returns hardcoded responses for testing
- __POST /askLLM__: Advanced endpoint that uses the FAISS vector store and LLM
- __GET /chat-history__: Get the conversation history
- __GET /health__: Check if the API is running and chatbot is initialized
- __POST /rebuild__: Force rebuild the vector store
- __GET /__: Health check endpoint

## Implementation Notes

The current implementation uses LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM for document processing but falls back to pytesseract OCR for text extraction due to compatibility issues with the models. This approach provides a good balance between reliability and quality, as we still benefit from:

1. The improved image processing pipeline
2. Better PDF and DOCX image extraction
3. Enhanced image preprocessing before OCR
4. Robust fallback mechanisms

In the future, when the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM models are more stable or updated versions are released, the commented-out code in the `process_image` method can be re-enabled to take full advantage of the layout understanding capabilities.


# Starting and Testing the SOP Chatbot API with LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM

I've created scripts to help you start and test the SOP Chatbot API with the LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM integration. Here's how to use them:

## Starting the API Server

1. __First, rebuild the vector store__ to ensure it's using the latest LayoutLMv3/LayoutXLM processing:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python rebuild_vector_store.py
   ```

2. __Start the API server__ using the new start script:

   ```bash
   ./start_api.sh
   ```

   This script:

   - Makes the set_env.sh script executable
   - Starts the API server with the correct environment settings
   - Automatically activates the virtual environment if it exists
   - Adds the current directory to the Python path
   - Suppresses FutureWarnings from the transformers library

   The API server will run on [](http://0.0.0.0:8000)<http://0.0.0.0:8000> by default.

## Testing the API

I've created several scripts to test the API:

### 1. Using the test_api_layout.py Script

This script provides several ways to test the API:

```bash
# Test the /askLLM endpoint (default)
./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py

# Test with a custom question
./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --question "What is the process for handling signed BAAs?"

# Test the /ask endpoint (simple hardcoded responses)
./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --no-llm

# Check API health
./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --health

# Trigger vector store rebuild
./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --rebuild
```

### 2. Using the test_simple_api.sh Script

This script tests the simple /ask endpoint which returns hardcoded responses:

```bash
./test_simple_api.sh
```

### 3. Using curl Directly

You can also test the API directly with curl:

```bash
# Test the /askLLM endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/askLLM \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "How do I process an unsigned BAA?", "use_llm": true}'

# Test the /ask endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "How do I process an unsigned BAA?"}'

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Trigger vector store rebuild
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/rebuild
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "Error processing question" response, here are some steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

1. __Check the API server logs__ for detailed error messages. The updated API now prints more detailed error information including full tracebacks.

2. __Check if the chatbot is initialized__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --health
   ```

   If `chatbot_initialized` is `false`, the chatbot failed to initialize. Check the API server logs for errors.

3. __Test the simple /ask endpoint__ which should work even if the LLM is having issues:

   ```bash
   ./test_simple_api.sh
   ```

4. __Rebuild the vector store__:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python rebuild_vector_store.py
   ```

   This will force rebuild the vector store with the improved document processing.

5. __Test with a simple question__ like "What is BASS?" which has a special case handler:

   ```bash
   ./set_env.sh python test_api_layout.py --question "What is BASS?"
   ```

6. __Check the Python path__ is set correctly. The updated `set_env.sh` script adds the current directory to the Python path, which should fix import errors.

7. __Verify the virtual environment__ is activated correctly. The `set_env.sh` script now automatically activates the virtual environment if it exists.

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- __POST /ask__: Simple endpoint that returns hardcoded responses for testing
- __POST /askLLM__: Advanced endpoint that uses the FAISS vector store and LLM
- __GET /chat-history__: Get the conversation history
- __GET /health__: Check if the API is running and chatbot is initialized
- __POST /rebuild__: Force rebuild the vector store
- __GET /__: Health check endpoint

## Implementation Notes

## Next Steps

If you continue to experience issues with the /askLLM endpoint, you might consider:

1. __Checking the vector store__: Make sure the vector store is properly built and contains the expected documents.

2. __Testing with different questions__: Try different questions to see if the issue is specific to certain queries.

3. __Examining the LLM pipeline__: The issue might be with the LLM pipeline rather than the document processing.

4. __Using the /ask endpoint temporarily__: While troubleshooting, you can use the /ask endpoint which provides hardcoded responses.

5. __Considering OpenAI/Claude integration__: As discussed earlier, integrating with OpenAI or Claude APIs could provide a more reliable solution, pending approval.
