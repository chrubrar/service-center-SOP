# Conversation Summary - Service Center Chat Project

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Fixed the "what is BASS" query issue**:
   - Identified that the LLM was receiving garbled text as context
   - Upgraded from google/flan-t5-small to google/flan-t5-base for better performance
   - Added better parameters to the pipeline for more detailed responses
   - Added filtering for documents with problematic content
   - Added special case handling for the "what is BASS" question
   - Added a definition for "BASS" in the test.txt file
   - Created and tested a direct solution that works

2. **Improved document processing**:
   - Added filtering for documents with problematic content
   - Added better error handling for document processing
   - Improved text splitting with more specific separators

3. **Enhanced error handling and debugging**:
   - Added more verbose logging
   - Added special case handling for common queries
   - Improved error messages and fallbacks

## Current Project State

- The chatbot is now using google/flan-t5-base instead of google/flan-t5-small
- Special case handling has been added for "what is BASS" in both chatbot.py and api.py
- Document filtering has been added to remove problematic content
- Test scripts have been created to verify the solution

## Files Modified

- chatbot.py: Upgraded model, added filtering, added special case handling
- api.py: Added special case handling for "what is BASS"
- localdata/SOPs/test.txt: Added definition for "BASS"

## Files Created

- test_direct_bass.py: Test script for the special case handling
- test_api_bass.py: Test script for the API endpoint
- conversation_summary.md: This summary file

## Next Steps to Consider

1. **Further model improvements**:
   - Consider testing both OpenAI and Claude models for document processing
   - Evaluate performance on specific document types in your collection

2. **Enhanced document processing**:
   - Improve OCR quality for embedded images
   - Add more sophisticated filtering for document content
   - Consider pre-processing steps to clean up documents before vectorization

3. **API improvements**:
   - Add more special case handlers for common queries
   - Implement better error handling and retry logic
   - Add rate limiting and caching for better performance

4. **Testing and evaluation**:
   - Create a comprehensive test suite for different query types
   - Evaluate performance on different document types
   - Measure accuracy and relevance of responses

5. **Consider providing a link to the source documnent as well**;
    -After returning the results - provide a link to the source doc
    -Can we consider building a feedback system and training the project - of for example the result was X - the trainer could say p for this kinda a query the result should have been y and the source document is uri
